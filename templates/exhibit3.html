                    The Dieppe raid is undoubtedly one of the most notable and significant battles during WW2 and debatably led to the ultimate victory of the Allied forces in their eventual recuperation of France. Initially, the Allied forces had planned on launching “Operation Overlord” which was devised to reclaim western Europe through the Normandy beaches but they ended up delaying it and instead decided to launch a raid on the French port of Dieppe called “Operation Rudder”. This battle was designed to help Russia by attracting German forces away from their war with Russia and gain experience by testing the equipment they had and that the Germans had for the success of the eventual aquatic invasion that they would need to defeat Germany. In this battle, nearly 5000 of the 6100 troops were Canadian. They had planned to attack five different points across the shore spanning around 16 kilometers long. However, their plan started falling apart before it even started. As their ships were approaching the coast of France, they were spotted by the landing craft of the eastern sector, this alerted the German coastal defenses readying their defense and allowing them to allocate more manpower to the area. Before long, the troops were overwhelmed as the Germans had set up a wide lineup of defensive tools along the coast to defend against invasions. This included thousands of concrete bunkers and pillboxes providing heavy artillery that would shred through our tanks and soldiers, obstacles spread throughout the beaches including explosives like landmines and naval mines which would explode troops tanks, and navy on contact, and hedgehogs which would immobilize tanks and trap landing craft, and tanks that were many times stronger than ours. To make matters worse, Dieppe beaches consisted of a wide cliff traversing across the entire coast and spanning many meters high. All of this led to a massive failure as from the 4,963 Canadians that embarked on this mission, only 2210 were able to return home with 3,367 casualties, 1,946 prisoners of war, and 916 deaths. Although controversial, this battle and the sacrifices of these soldiers were not in vain as it was undoubtedly helpful for the planning of the eventual D-day greatly minimizing casualties and if it were not for the intel that we got from this battle, WW2 could have ended in a completely different way.
